# MDeep-implementation
Implementation of MDeep and evaluation based on Bukavina et al [1]

## Data Management

This repository contains the implementation code for MDeep. The raw genomic sequencing data files (`.gz`, `.fq.gz`, `.fastq.gz`) are not included in this repository due to their large size and incompatibility.

### Data Structure
The data directory contains _merged_ genomic sequencing data from three countries: 3_countries, China_Hung, Croatia_Hung, and China_Croatia, where:
- `China` - Chinese cohort samples (62 cancer patients and 19 healthy controls)
- `Croatia` - Croatian cohort samples (14 cancer patients and 11 healthy controls)
- `Hungary` - Hungarian cohort samples (10 cancer patients)
